This is version 0.01 of PaZZT, a ZZT clone implemented in Turbo Pascal.

The current version is able to load a ZZT world file, and allows the player
to walk around the map. There's also some very limited support for ZZT-OOP
scripts (only text and menus implemented, so far). My final goal is to make
it able to run ZZT games with around 95% of accuracy, and then maybe I'll
start making enhancements over the original ZZT.

The source code is under the .\SRC subdirectory. You're free to do whatever
you wish with it.

My homepage is http://www.haroldoop.hpg.com.br you'll find lots of game
programming related source code there.
If you want to download the original ZZT, try zzt.the-underdogs.org . They
have quite a lot of ZZT games to download.
