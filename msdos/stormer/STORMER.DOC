                        by Haroldo de Oliveira Pinheiro


============
Introduction
============

    STORMER is a fast-action shoot-em-up for the IBM-PC, based on an old
 Atari 2600 classic, TURMOIL.
    Your objective in this game is simple: Shoot them before they hit you.

===================
System requirements
===================

    To play STORMER, you will need:

      -386 compatible CPU
      -VGA video card
      -a mouse

    For maximum enjoyment, the recommended configuration is:

      -a 486DX2-66 or better
      -VGA video card (no SVGA support, yet)
      -a mouse
      -a soundcard (SB, SB Pro, SB 16 or GUS)
      -VERY FAST REFLEXES!!!

The story
=========

    Story? This is a shoot-em-up, not a RPG!
    Okay, okay. So you want a story, anyway. Let me see...
    The alien invasion fleet is hurtling towards earth, and only you
 and your STORMER space ship can save our planet from destruction.
    (OK, this story is simply horrible, but I'm a programmer, not a writer)

How to play
===========

    When you start the game, the first thing you will see is a little
 intro screen, after wich you will see a little menu, with a demonstration
 of the game running on the background.
    The menu should be pretty self-explanatory, but I'll describe it anyway:

          Start new game        -      Starts a new game
          Instructions          -      Brief instuctions of how to play
          Credits               -      Game credits and some technical info
          Exit to DOS           -      Exits to DOS

    To activate an option, just press the key indicated by the letter in
 red.
    Once inside the game, you can use the following commands:
          
          Mouse                 -      Moves your ship
          L/R Mouse buttons     -      Fire your cannons
          P                     -      Pauses/Unpauses the game
          +,-                   -      Increase/Decrease vertical
                                       mouse sensitivity
          ],[                   -      Increase/Decrease horizontal
                                       mouse sensitivity
          ESC                   -      Aborts the game

    As mentioned above in this document, the objective in this game is
 very simple, you just have to kill anything in your sight. After blowing up
 a certain number of enemies, you will warp to the next level, with new and
 faster enemies. Of course, each killed enemy increases your score. When you
 lose all your lives, you'll see a screen showing the high scores. If you
 do well enough, you will see a little blinking message in the high score
 table, asking for you to enter your name.

Technical information
=====================
    
    This game was made in about two months by me, Haroldo de Oliveira Pinheiro,
 with Turbo Pascal 7.0(TM), during my spare time.
    I've used the XLib graphics library for the graphics, and DSIK for the
 sound system.
    The game uses a planar high-resolution mode X 320x400, no split-screen.
 All the sprites were drawn using the BEX sprite editor, which came with the
 TP version of XLib. The intro screen was drawn with Aldus Photo Styler(TM)
 and Paint Shop Pro 4(TM).
    As said above, the Digital Sound Interface Kit (DSIK) was used to handle
 the sounds. I've selected the sounds from some sound effects CD's, and
 modified them a little with Goldwave(TM).
