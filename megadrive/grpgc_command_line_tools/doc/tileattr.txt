Format: <tile number> [attributes]
The attributes can tell from which directions the tile is
blocked (TOP, LEFT, BOTTOM, RIGHT, OPEN, SOLID, SIDES, UPDOWN),
which pallete it will use (PAL0, PAL1, PAL2, PAL3), or
if it will appear over or under the actors (FRONT, BACK)
Any line which is started with ; is considered to be a comment.
