"In Cobble Crawl"
You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.
There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.

"Orange River Chamber"
You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.
The walls are frozen rivers of orange stone.
An awkward canyon and a good passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.
