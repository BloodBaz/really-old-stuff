To compile Ultimate Tetris:
   1. Go to the .\GRAPHICS subdirectory, and run MKALL.BAT
      MKALL will convert all the .PCX files into maps/tilesets, so that they
      can be used by SEGA Genesis.
   2. Still on the .\GRAPHICS subdirectory, run MKDAT.BAT
      It will take all tilesets, maps, sounds, etc., and convert them all to
      a PATCHDAT resource file (ULTRDAT.DAT), and the correspondent .H file
      (ULTRDAT.H)
   3. Return to the main source directory and run MAKE (please, use either
      Borland MAKE or GNU MAKE, not the one that comes with SGCC). It will
      compile all the code, link it, and then insert the graphics/sound/map
      data to the ROM by using PATCHDAT.
   4. Open the rom with Genecyst (you can get it on any good emulation site),
      then choose "File->Fix ROM CheckSum". If you don't have Genecyst, find
      some utility that can fix the CheckSum of SEGA Genesis' ROMs, and use
      it.
   5. Well, now your ROM (ULTETRIS.BIN) should run on any SEGA Genesis
      emulator.
